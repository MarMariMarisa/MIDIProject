1) unsigned char q1 = 73;
   Convert q1 to a binary number (show all steps)
   Convert q1 to a hexidecimal number (show all steps)


2) signed char q2 = -5;
   Convert q2 to a binary number (show all steps)
   Convert q2 to a hexidecimal nubmer (show all steps)


3) unsigned char q3 = 0b11010110;
   Convert q3 to a hexadecimal number (show all steps)
   Convert q3 to a decimal number (show all steps)


4) Given: unsinged char a = 26;
	  unsinged char b = 55;
	  char c = 0;
   What would the value of c be (in binary) after completeing each of the 
   following operations (show all steps in binary):
   a) c = a & b;
   b) c = a | b;
   c) c = a ^ b;
   d) c = ~a;
   e) c = a << 2;
   f) c = a >> 2;


5) Using only the value variable and any combination of &,|,~,<<, and >>, 
   Write a function that would return a 1 if the leftmost (MSB) bit of vlaue 
   is set and a 0 if it is not set. This should be only 2-3 lines of code.
