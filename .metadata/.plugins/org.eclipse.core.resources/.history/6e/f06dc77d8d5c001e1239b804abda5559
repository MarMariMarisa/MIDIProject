4) Given: unsinged char a = 26;
		in binary
		26/2 = 13 re 0
		13/2 = 6  re 1
		6/2  = 3  re 0
		3/2  = 1 re  1
		1/2  = 0  re 1
		11010
	  unsinged char b = 55;
	  55 / 2 = 27 re 1
	  27 / 2 = 13 re 1
	  13 / 2 =  6 re 1
	  6  / 2 =  3 re 0
	  3  / 2 = 1  re 1
	  1 / 2 =  0  re 1
	  110111
	  
	  char c = 0;
	  
   What would the value of c be (in binary) after completeing each of the 
   following operations (show all steps in binary):
   a) c = a & b;
      	011010
      	110111
      
        c =010010
   b) c = a | b;
   		011010
    	110111
    	
    	c = 111111
   
   c) c = a ^ b;
   		011010
    	110111
    	
    	c = 101101
    	
   d) c = ~a;
   		011010
    	
    	c = 100101
   e) c = a << 2;
   		011010
   		
   		c = 0110 1000
    	
   f) c = a >> 2;
   		011010
    	
    	c = 0110


5) Using only the value variable and any combination of &,|,~,<<, and >>, 
   Write a function that would return a 1 if the leftmost (MSB) bit of vlaue 
   is set and a 0 if it is not set. This should be only 2-3 lines of code.
   
   unint8_t msb_set (unint8_t value) {
		return (value >> x) & 1;

   }
